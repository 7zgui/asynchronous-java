## Use Case
#### Consider a user apply for a product such as a credit card or debit card from front-end UI.
#### Now once at the backend, we receive user requests, we perform n number of use cases such as validation, transformation, persist to DB and sending acknowledgment email, etc.
#### Now all of these processes donâ€™t have to be synchronous. For example, we can send emails to customers irrespective of saving them to the database.
So we can execute this piece of logic asynchronously.
